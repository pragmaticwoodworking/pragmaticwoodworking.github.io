If you haven't heard, maybe you don't know, but this week in La Crosse WI is
Sawlapalooza at [Bad Axe Tool Works](http://www.badaxetoolworks.com/).  What's Sawlapalooza you ask?  Its a five
day course with Mark Harrell and [Tom Fidgen](http://www.theunpluggedwoodshop.com/).  You get expert instruction about
everything back saws from Mark (well almost everything).  Complimented
with woodworking expertise from Tom.  WOW!!!

Day one of Sawlapalooza was everything I expected it to be.  First, twenty two
participants where divided into two groups.  Half started off the day with
Mark, the other half started off with Tom.  I was in the group that started off
with Mark. He welcomed us with a description of the types of back saws that
exist, the difference between a static back and a traditional folded back saw,
and the pros and cons of each.  After the introduction we broke off into groups
where Mark and his staff taught us how to take a back saw apart properly
without damaging the saw, clean it, put it back together and retension it.  It
was a world of valuable information and in person instruction.  It was a
glimpse into how Bad Axe builds saws, sets the teeth, and sharpens their saws.
You think you know saws, well, you don't know saws until you go through a
session with Mark and his team.  It shows they care about the work they do, and
they have a very logical and practical approach to building saws.  I was
surprised how you can bring a saw back to life in a short amount of time.  If
you ever get the chance to take a class with Mark and his team, I would highly
recommend it.

After lunch, the two teams switched it up, and it was our turn to start work on
the saw bench designed by the master woodworker himself, Tom Fidgen.  He
presented us with an introduction into the design of the bench, and why its setup the
way it is.  Then we started on 4 lap joints for the legs and stretchers.  That
doesn't seem like a lot but it took 4 hours to do.  It was our chance to put
to good use the skills that we've built up over the years.  Tom was there to provide
instruction and help when needed.

Here's the thing.  I just spent the day with the most hospital bunch, willing
to share their professional knowledge, with a group of hobbyist.  They are
professionals at the top of their game.  They have all the right to gloat and
bask in their own success, but they don't.  They are proud of what they do, and
it shows.  Their passion towards their craft is infectious.  The wealth of
knowledge is captivating.  An indirect side affect of this humbled method of
deliver is the strong community that follows in its wake.  I can't wait
for day two.
