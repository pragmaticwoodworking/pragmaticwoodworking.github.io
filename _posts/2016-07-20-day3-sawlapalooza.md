Day 3 started off with us getting a review of what we learned thus far.  Making
the plate, setting the teeth, jointing the tooth line, and filing.  It was a
confidence builder day.  Try it, assess, correct.  This
was the day to build muscle memory necessary to be good at sharpening your
own saws.  As I worked through my kerfing plate I was really feeling like I was
getting it.  I was noticing the facets that form on the teeth before giving
that final filing stroke.  Twenty minutes later I was through with the filing
when I asked for an assessment.  Needless to say, my plate wasn't as good
as I had hoped.  Well, you can't teach somebody to sharpen in a week, at least
you can't expect to much from them anyway.  But I was committed to the pursuit
of excellence.

Day 3 was also the start of our second woodworking project.  The frame saw.
Now this is a big saw.  That build out was going pretty good for me.  Its not a
difficult build.  You just gotta keep all the measurements in check, which I
guess is true for any project.  This is also a project where maybe your joinery
skills can relax a little.  The rigidity in the saw comes from squeezing the
parts together with the saw plate.  Two housing dados really stabilize the
saw frame.  Two of my tenons fit a little loose.  Not sure what happened.  Probably
getting into my head again.  But I have an out.  Towards the end of the day
we found out that our measurements for the length of the stretchers were
long.  Long is good.  Short bad.  I'll have to shorting the stretchers a bit, and
take that opportunity to fix up the tenons.  I'm excited to complete this project.
